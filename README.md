# WheelRobot_V1B
A simple wheel robot using differential drive locomotion, with Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer running ROS2 middleware for high-level control and monitoring. The robot has a custom low-level robot controller board using the chip dsPIC33CK512MP606 as the processor for controlling the DC motors and interfacing with on-board sensors. See the PDF file in this repo for the details of the low-level robot controller.
